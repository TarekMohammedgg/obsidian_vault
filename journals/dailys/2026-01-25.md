- [x] create an courses database to finish like a list to know the courses I want to finish and put the duration inside quarterly and weekly review .


Today , I began a conversation with ChatGPT and start talking about random topics, such as whether  Ai will replace human creativity and act ChatGPT like an HR  and start asking  me questions about my work , like what the last project i worked on was  and what challenges i faced . finally, i was asked what skills i would recommend in my team. 
then we switched the conversation to talk about kindergarten. and asked him to  rate my fluency and pronunciation. He rated me 8 out of 10 ,which  seems pretty well, However,  i noticed that i need to  use new vocabs that i  have recently learned and listening more and more and increase my effort to get the results I want.
