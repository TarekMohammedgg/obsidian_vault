### Notes 
\- logical operations in mask is : AND , OR , XOR 
\- we using edge detection and subtracting for best analysis for image 
\- the commonly segmentation technique   is histogram-based , for diff between background and object element  , but not work well with complex image because overlapping intensity levels make the peaks unclear . 
\- blank image is the canvass for adding and subtracting . 
\- Texture and shape based is the most computational segmentation technique . 
\- threshold important to achieve Separating regions by intensity to define objects and background
\- region based is A combination of texture, shape, and color data to define distinct regions
