## Important Notes while solving questions 

hacktivist == suicide hackers 

vulnerability => for passively uncovering vulnerability 

the goal of the contract is Proof the permissions 

message digest function == Hashing function 

EDGAR => for check financial filling 

fine tune search result => operators like (site : , url : , allintext : )

Foot printing has two phases is Active and Passive 

pretexting => posing as technical support for exploit important information from the victims 

in social Engineering : 
Executive => (not security focused , helpful ) 
Receptionists=> (not security focused , focus on business process and sales )

hardware keyloggers =>  difficult to install on the target system 

the Trojan horse relies on social engineering to be activated 

the logical bomb comes with two parts : triggers and payload , the payload wait until the trigger wake up  it .
