#ml_and_dnn #clustering 

is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm. 

the goal of this algo is to grouping un labelled dataset into different clusters based on similarity . 

this algorithm work by picking a random point and name it centroid and after all points are assigned to a cluster the centroid will update by finding the average position of the points in each cluster .
