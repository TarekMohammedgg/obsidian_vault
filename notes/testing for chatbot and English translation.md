{ "Translated_conversation": "Patient: How are you? \nAssistant: I'm fine, praise be to God. Can you tell me what your problem is?\nPatient: I have an itch in my left shoulder.\nAssistant: When did this itch start?\nPatient: It started about a week ago, but the pain was mild at first, but it increased in the last few days.\nAssistant: Have you noticed any changes in the area you're experiencing, like a change in color, size, texture, or the appearance of scales or any other changes?\nPatient: It was normal at first, but with all the scratching, it became red.\nAssistant: Are there any other symptoms accompanying the itch, such as pain, bleeding, or any other sensation?\nPatient: No, I haven't used any ointments, but I scratch it with cool water from time to time, and there are no side effects with the itch.\nAssistant: Is there anything that increases the itch, such as tight clothing or friction?\nPatient: No, because my work is from home, and I haven't gotten sunburned or any burns in that area, but the problem started when I ate fish.\nAssistant: Is there a family history of similar cases, such as skin cancer or unusual moles?\nPatient: It's an intense itch, and yes, my father has an allergy to seafood.\nAssistant: Is there anything else you want to add?\nPatient: No.\nAssistant: Thank you for the information. Bring the picture that shows the itch so we can consider it, and we'll discuss it with the doctor." }
