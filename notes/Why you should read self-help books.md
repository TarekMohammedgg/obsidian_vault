Today, I am gonna talk about why we sometimes  ashamed from reading self-help books. We feel like that ,because journalists don't talk about it and appear romantic books and other books which they don't help us in real life. Also, in university this topic is treat like something we must hide it. I don't why we do like this action. We mustn't judge the authors when talk about real life experience and be active with them by applying good things and leave other. Finally, I want to start return self-help books to true place.
