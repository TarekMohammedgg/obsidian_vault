#  Corrected Version

Some habits are ingrained in us, and some actions we do without thinking about them.

Habits like nail-biting or rubbing our hair are examples of this.

Every habit has some steps. One of them is the cue, which is the trigger of the habit. It is like a voice inside you telling you to do something. You don’t know why, but it comes from your mind.

There are two types of habits: good habits and bad habits. When we say that habits are ingrained, we do not mean that they are unchangeable. We mean that they need more effort to replace or remove.

As we said above, replacing a bad habit with a good one can be one of the solutions to break bad habits.

I will give an example. When I was young, I used to play soccer with my friends without wearing shoes. This caused some problems in my feet when I became an adult. I overcame this habit by wearing shoes every time I decided to go outside.  
I kept the same trigger but changed the action.

Finally, as they say, everything has pros and cons. Just as we have bad habits, we also have good ones.
