Today When I was scrolling through my  YouTube, I saw a hook subtitle  called" How to make your stress work for you" , This subtitle made me think about how stress can help me focus. it was very impressive to me, as  you had  a magical power  to turn your focus from nothing or distribution into focus. But wait, I know that  stress has bad impact on our bodies when it lasts for along time. in the short term, It affects my body by  pushing energy and helping me focus, for example , to move  away from a speeding  car on road and increasing memory retention. All these benefits depend on one factor: stress must be short-term, not long.
