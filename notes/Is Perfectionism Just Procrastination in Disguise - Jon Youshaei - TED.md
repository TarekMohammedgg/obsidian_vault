# Writing 
i will summarize this video , the video was talking about bad reflect about perfectionism and how it can waste a lot of your time and advice us to start doing something imperfect is better than doesn't exits , and he give us some examples about innovators and entrepreneurs like mozet and monet and talk about monet's experiment in paris  when he slashed with knife her painting cause it was perfection as he thought , after that the teacher said this painting's value is around 2 million dollars . 
i talked about self experiment also , he is a content creator on YouTube and he make videos for living , first his perspective is quality over quantity ,but after he realized he just published 6 videos on YouTube last year , he start to change his perspective and start search behind popular videos on YouTube and from masterpiece-making machine creators in YouTube how they manage their channel , and he was stagging when he saw one of the popular and saw his content that was talking about impersonators and making interviews and he embarrassing from his self and change his perspective to quality over quantity 
is the correct situation , and something from his soul tell him to debut despite imperfections .
