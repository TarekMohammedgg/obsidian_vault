### Syncing in obsidian ? 
- i am using obsidian around 1 year .. it is so so good note taking application for me .... just note taking app. 
- the problem of syncing using google drive appearance when using any thing else note taking like (insert tasks or projects planners or daily notes )  , the problem with these is overwriting and slow when transfer data from laptop to phone or any device else .... when think about obsidian sync i find the cost is very high for me and when think to use alternatives tools like syncthing i find a lot of efforts should do to handle obsidian with syncthing
