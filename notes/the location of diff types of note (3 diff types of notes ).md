in my life , the types of note that i took it never out of 3 types : 
1. project notes 
2. configuration and setup notes 
3. simplification notes 

the question is what is the location of each type of not ?

## Summary 
project notes => in folder in the project named `docs` contain the setup and any packages you needed it 

setup notes => if it easy to find it on google (trust google) else write it as a note in your note taking app ,  or save it as a snippet 

simplification notes => the second brain is valuable
