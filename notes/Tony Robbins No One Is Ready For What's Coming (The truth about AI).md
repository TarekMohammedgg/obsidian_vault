Today, I'm going to talk about how  can a difficult  worthless life be tough and painful. 
This podcast talked about an adult who had  four fathers, his mom was instance and strong. 
He remembered an event when a foreign person knocked on  their door and wanted to give them  a frozen turkey.  the adult was very happy because he hadn't eaten for four days , but his dad became very angry. he opened the door and said to the man "we don't take charity food" then slammed the door without waiting to listen to him . 
The adult  was shocked  and couldn't  understand why his father did that ? 
He didn't forget the incident and kept it in his mind for years . 
After many years he talked to a church near  his home about this event and asked : what should we  say when give  food for a  poor family? 
They answered him and said that the food is given from God . 
He bought some groceries from a supermarket and went to give them to a poor  family.  He knocked on the door and said: "Please, take this food and have a good day" . He was surprised when the Asian woman kissed his cheek  and was delighted. 
He believes that any person can turn the worst day into the best day ever.
